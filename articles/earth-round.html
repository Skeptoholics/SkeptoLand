<p>Most people say they <em>know</em> the Earth is round. Ask them how, and the answer usually isn’t a chain of measurements — it’s a chain of trust.</p>
<p>That isn’t an insult. It’s a practical strategy. No one individually verifies everything they believe. We inherit conclusions through teachers, textbooks, documentaries, diagrams, and the quiet social pressure of consensus.</p>

<h2>Belief is cheap. Knowledge is costly.</h2>
<p>Belief can be installed in a minute. Knowledge is slower: it demands methods, instruments, calibration, error bars, and a willingness to discover that your favorite story was a shortcut.</p>
<p>When someone says “I know,” they often mean “I’ve heard the explanation and it sounds coherent.” Coherence is not evidence; it’s just the feeling of evidence.</p>

<h2>Where does the certainty come from?</h2>
<p>There are strong reasons to accept a spherical Earth: multiple independent measurement methods, predictable navigation, satellite systems, astronomy, and physics that make consistent predictions. The point here isn’t to deny those reasons — it’s to notice <em>how</em> we personally relate to them.</p>
<p>For most of us, the evidence is mostly secondhand. We’re trusting that the instruments exist, that the measurements were done competently, that the results were reported honestly, and that the incentives did not distort the story.</p>

<h2>A better claim</h2>
<p>Instead of “I know the Earth is round,” try: “The best-supported model I’m aware of is that the Earth is roughly spherical, and it reliably predicts outcomes across many domains.”</p>
<p>That phrasing sounds less heroic. It’s also more accurate. It separates identity from belief. And it leaves room for the real work: learning what would convince you if consensus vanished tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Borrowed confidence</h2>
<p>Borrowed confidence is not a sin — it’s a budget. But budgets should be visible. If you don’t know which links in your trust-chain are strong, you’re not informed; you’re merely socialized.</p>
