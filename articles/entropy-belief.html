<p>Overconfidence feels like clarity. It’s the mind’s way of collapsing uncertainty into a single, clean story — preferably one that flatters our judgment.</p>
<p>Entropy, in the loosest useful sense, is what happens when you stop pretending the world is tidy. Systems drift. Noise accumulates. “Good enough” today becomes “wrong” tomorrow, not because anyone lied, but because complexity keeps moving.</p>

<h2>Belief as a compression algorithm</h2>
<p>Beliefs compress reality. They reduce a messy landscape into a manageable file size: a few rules, a few categories, a few predictions. Compression is necessary. It’s also lossy.</p>
<p>Overconfidence is what happens when we forget the lossiness — when we confuse our compressed model for the full-resolution world.</p>

<h2>Why entropy punishes arrogance</h2>
<p>High-confidence predictions fail in two common ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unmodeled variables:</strong> the thing you didn’t measure becomes the thing that mattered.</li>
  <li><strong>Distribution shift:</strong> the environment changes and your model keeps answering an old question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Entropy isn’t “chaos” in a mystical sense. It’s a reminder that information decays and assumptions age.</p>

<h2>A practical antidote</h2>
<p>Build beliefs that expect to be revised. Track what would change your mind. Prefer multiple weak signals over one strong narrative. And when you feel the warm glow of certainty, treat it like a symptom — not a conclusion.</p>

<p class="uv-hidden" data-uv>UV NOTE: Confidence is often a social performance. Accuracy is usually quiet.</p>
