<p>The Archive had a rule: every claim needed a source. The rule sounded noble until you read the sources.</p>
<p>Most were citations of citations — paper trails that ended in the same handful of names. The Archivists called it “triangulation.” Mara called it “a choir repeating its favorite hymn.”</p>
<p>She requested the raw data. A clerk smiled and handed her a form. The form asked for her reason. Mara wrote: <em>To see whether the story survives without the storyteller.</em></p>
<p>Three weeks later the response arrived: “Data unavailable. Summary provided.” The summary was a paragraph. The paragraph was confident. The paragraph was also untestable.</p>
<p>Mara started collecting contradictions instead — the places where the official story had to bend around reality. The Archive didn’t like contradictions. Contradictions were expensive to store.</p>
<p>She noticed something: the institution wasn’t built to be correct. It was built to be <em>stable</em>. Stability preferred the story that required the least maintenance.</p>
