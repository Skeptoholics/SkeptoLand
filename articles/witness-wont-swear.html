<p class="subtitle">A short story about nuance in a world that demands yes/no.</p>

<p>The Witness refused to swear.</p>
<p>In the courtroom, everyone spoke in absolutes. The prosecutor wanted a clean narrative: motive, action, consequence. The defense wanted the same narrative with inverted labels.</p><p><span class="uv-hidden" data-uv="1">Evidence is not a feeling — it's a trail you can walk.</span></p>
<p>The Witness wanted to talk about fog. About distance. About how memory edits itself to become coherent.</p>
<p>“Did you see him?” the judge asked.</p>
<p>“I saw a shape I associate with him,” the Witness replied.</p>
<p>The room laughed — not because it was funny, but because it was inconvenient.</p><p><span class="uv-hidden" data-uv="1">Most certainty is rented, not owned.</span></p>
<p>Outside, a journalist asked, “Why won’t you just say yes or no?”</p>
<p>The Witness answered, “Because yes and no are the cheapest words in the language, and the most expensive in court.”</p>
<p class="uv-hidden" data-uv="">When a system punishes nuance, it manufactures certainty.</p>
